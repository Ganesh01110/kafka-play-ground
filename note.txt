piyushgarg->kafka crashcourse
kafka has high throughput
millions of operation can be easily done in kafka i.e high ops(operation per second)
not an alternative to database
storage is temporary and very low
in otherhand db has higher storage but throughput is very low
in db we can query data but not in kafka
 

architechture:
---------------
uber-vehicle(speed,location etc) ----> kafka ----->postgres  (direct communication cann create throughput problem)
     (producers)                    (consumers) ---->fare \
                                         |----->analytics - {bulk insert into db}
                                         |------>customer /

            / ==topic-1  (rider data) {data cluttering when amount increase} => solve by partition
kafka-server
  broker    \ ==topic-2  (consumer data)   {for production and consumption}
                 | ====> partition-1 \  {based on various condition}
                 | ====> partition-2 /   (work on indexing or some logic)
-->partition allocation works on auto-balancing or self-balancing concept
one consumer can consume multiple partition but one partition only can consumed by only one


consumer groups :
-----------------
auto-balancing works on group level
=>by using groups and consumer-producer concept we can implement both queue and pub-sub model

kafka-zookeeper ::  https://www.openlogic.com/blog/using-kafka-zookeeper
work together to form a kafka cluster
distributed clustering services , kafka handle = data streams and connectivity to clients.
