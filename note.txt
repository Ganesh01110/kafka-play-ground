piyushgarg->kafka crashcourse
kafka has high throughput
millions of operation can be easily done in kafka i.e high ops(operation per second)
not an alternative to database
storage is temporary and very low
in otherhand db has higher storage but throughput is very low
in db we can query data but not in kafka
